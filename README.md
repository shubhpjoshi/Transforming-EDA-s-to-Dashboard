# Transforming-EDA-s-to-Dashboard
##In the project we are analyzing Airbnbâ€™s New York City(NYC) data of 2019. NYC is not only the famous city in the world but also has top global destination for visitors attracted to its museums, entertainment, restaurants, UN offices and commerce.

Our project started by understanding the Airbnb dataset, which includes property information like availability, price, location, reviews, and ratings.

We looked at various aspects, such as the number of listings, host characteristics, amenities, and occupancy rates. We also studied the significance of user reviews.

We used techniques like data visualization and objective analysis to draw meaningful conclusions. For example, we created charts to show property distribution in different neighborhoods.

This analysis helps Airbnb improve customer satisfaction and rental revenues, while also benefiting renters in making informed decisions.
